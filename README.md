# About

Cybersecurity student

Interested in cryptography and privacy.

### Projects:
- [VaultCord](https://vaultcord.com), keep your Discord members secure from deletion (actively operating)
- [KeyAuth](https://keyauth.cc), software licensing API for programmers (sold company)
- ~~RestoreCord, Discord application. VaultCord but not as good. (sold company)~~

### I support:
- Organizations defending internet users' rights, such as the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org/).
- Open-source software, such as the password manager [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) & the email forwarding service [SimpleLogin](https://simplelogin.io/).
- Archival websites, such as [archive.today](https://archive.is/) (the wayback machine does too much censorship).
- Companies that do their best to allow free speech, such as [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/).

### Contact

Not interested in direct contact. If you require assistance, reach out through the appropriate website.

If it's about a project I released for free and explictly disabled GitHub issues on, that means I have no interest in answering queries about the project. You can do some research on Google and learn to code. I believe in you.
